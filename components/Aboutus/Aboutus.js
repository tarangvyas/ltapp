                <p>The concept is very simple yet very effective, by offering your car to more buyers not only are you likely to get more for it but it ensures you get the true trade value for your car.</p>
                <p>Rather than negotiating with one dealer we turn the traditional process of trading your car upside down by putting your Lotus in front of dealers and specialists through the UK. The best bit? you can do it all from the comfort of your home! Lotus Trader helps re-balance the relationship between car owners and professional car buyers, making sure you get the best possible price.</p>
                <p>Unlike a private sale or an online auction, you're dealing with seasoned and respected industry professionals who have been checked out by us. They have the money and a constant need for new vehicles, meaning that you can sell your car quickly to someone you trust.</p>
                <p>We only disclose your contact details to someone who has made a firm offer to buy your car - so you'll only get a call from a serious buyer. What's more, it's completely free, with no admin charges in the small print.</p>

                <p>By advertising your car to the Lotus network across the UK, Lotus Trader makes dealers compete for your car. It maximises the price you can get when compared with a trade-in or sale to a traditional dealer or car buying service.</p>

                <p>As a general guide, you should expect to get more than online car buying services and a competitive price when compared to part-exchange values.</p>

                <p>As a general rule, it is likely to be less than you would achieve from a private sale, but you will benefit from all the convenience and reassurance of dealing with vetted, trustworthy buyers.</p>

                <p>Remember that the price of the same model will usually be higher on the forecourt, because the dealer will need to cover their own costs and profit margin when they sell.</p>

That way, dealers will know what they're bidding on, and will ensure that the offer you're given is honoured when they come to inspect and collect the car.</p>
